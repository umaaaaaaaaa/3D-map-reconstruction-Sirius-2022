# 3D-map-reconstruction-Sirius-2022
Neural network reconstruction of 3D semantic maps, AIRI x Sirius 2022

## The Task of the project

The goal is a 3D reconstruction of the bottom surface, with which we can then calculate the volume of the biotope (in our case crabs). At the entrance, we receive a monocular video extracted from online recordings of the seabed from youtube. As a result, we get a three-dimensional map in the form of a mesh with detected crabs and the volume of crabs found in the video

The project is relevant because it is necessary to automate detailed underwater research, which is mandatory in the Russian Federation. The areas of application can be:
- Exploration inspection work on water bodies
- Environmental monitoring during construction on the continental shelf
- Monitoring of fishing sites
